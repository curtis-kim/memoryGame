## MEMORY GAME
Users to tarack a pattern
In Memory Game, the user needs to quickly memorize a group of tiles on a grid. That means
remembering their location, and maybe even the shapes they create.

The game "challenges a part of your short-term memory called spatial recall â€” your ability to
track location and position within an environment".
The game is of type Dynamic game difficulty balancing (adapts with the user skill and gets
harder or easier with respect to the user ability)
If wrong tiles are pressed the next matrix gets generated with lower number of tiles, or smaller
size (a 5X5 matrix with 6 tiles, will turn to a 5X5 matrix with 5 tiles or 5X4 matrix with 6 tiles)
if the user successfully clicked all the tiles then the game becomes one step more difficult (a 5X5
matrix with 6 tiles, will turn to a 5X5 matrix with 7 tiles or 6X5 matrix with 6 tiles)

## SCORE Calculation
Each time the user clicks on wrong button loses 1 score, each time clicks the correct tile, gets +1 scores

## Termination of the game

To terminate the game either user's score gets down to 0 or negative, or the user presses
"Terminate" button
Upon termination, display a summary page
